Can't imagine where I'd be if Pascal didn't believe
Couldn't afford to pay my rent
Couldn't afford somethin' to eat
But he was always there, anytime I needed to vent
He just play the beat and I'm speaking with real intent
I ain't have to pay a thing we would split the percent
Making music out his Momma's basement
It's more than rap that's my brudda for life
He said I don't owe him a thing but he know it's only right
